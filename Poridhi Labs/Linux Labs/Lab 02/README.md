# Linux User and Group Management

Managing users and groups is a fundamental aspect of Linux system administration. This lab will guide you through creating user accounts, managing groups, assigning users to groups, and locking user accounts. These tasks are crucial for effectively controlling user access and permissions.

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:
- Create user accounts.
- Create and manage groups.
- Assign users to primary and supplementary groups.
- Lock and verify user accounts. 

## Understanding Key Concepts

### 1. Primary and Supplementary Groups

- A **primary group** is the default group assigned to a user when they create new files. Each user must have a primary group.
- **Supplementary groups** provide additional permissions and access to resources. A user can belong to multiple supplementary groups, which help in fine-grained access control.

#### Example:

Imagine a company where employees belong to different departments. When a new software developer joins, they are assigned to the `Developers` group as their primary group. However, they also need access to project documentation, so they are added to the `Docs` group as a supplementary group.

### 2. Locking a User Account

Locking a user account prevents the user from logging in without deleting their data or removing their access permanently. This is useful for temporarily restricting access.

#### Example:

A system administrator needs to temporarily disable access for an employee who is on a long vacation. Instead of deleting their account, the admin locks it so that they cannot log in until they return.

## Lab Tasks

We will understand the whole process of creating users and groups using the example of `Poridhi` where we will create 4 users and 1 group.

### 1. Adding Users to the System

**Objective:** Create user accounts for employees of `Poridhi`.

**Command:**

```bash
sudo useradd <username>
```

**Explanation:**
- The `useradd` command creates a new user.
- By default, a home directory is assigned unless specified otherwise.
- The primary group is the same as the username by default.

Now we will create 4 users `nabil`, `minhaz`, `yasin`, and `fazlul`.

```bash
sudo useradd nabil
sudo useradd minhaz
sudo useradd yasin
sudo useradd fazlul
```

**Verification:**

```bash
id nabil
```
Example output:
```
uid=1001(nabil) gid=1001(nabil) groups=1001(nabil)
```

### 2. Creating the `Poridhi-Minions` Group

**Objective:** Create a group for administrative users.

**Command:**
```bash
sudo groupadd poridhi-minions
```

**Explanation:**
- The `groupadd` command creates a new group.
- Groups allow multiple users to share permissions efficiently.

**Verification:**
```bash
getent group poridhi-minions
```
Example output:
```
poridhi-minions:x:1002:
```

### 3. Assigning a Primary Group to a User

**Objective:** Set `poridhi-minions` as the primary group for `nabil`.

**Command:**
```bash
sudo usermod -g poridhi-minions nabil
```

**Explanation:**
- The `usermod` command modifies user settings.
- The `-g` option changes the primary group.

**Verification:**
```bash
id nabil
```
Example output:
```
uid=1001(nabil) gid=1002(poridhi-minions) groups=1002(poridhi-minions)
```

### 4. Adding Users to a Supplementary Group

**Objective:** Add `minhaz`, `yasin`, and `fazlul` to `poridhi-minions` as a supplementary group.

**Command:**
```bash
sudo usermod -aG poridhi-minions <username>
```

**Explanation:**
- The `-aG` option appends a user to a supplementary group without removing them from existing groups.
- Users in supplementary groups gain additional access privileges.

**Commands:**
```bash
sudo usermod -aG poridhi-minions minhaz
sudo usermod -aG poridhi-minions yasin
sudo usermod -aG poridhi-minions fazlul
```

**Verification:**
```bash
id minhaz
```
Example output:
```
uid=1002(minhaz) gid=1002(minhaz) groups=1002(minhaz),1002(poridhi-minions)
```

### 5. Locking a User Account

**Objective:** Temporarily disable the user account of `fazlul`.

**Command:**
```bash
sudo usermod -L fazlul
```

**Explanation:**
- The `-L` option locks an account, preventing password-based login.
- The userâ€™s data remains intact.

**Verification:**
```bash
passwd -S fazlul
```
Example output:
```
fazlul L 2024-01-28 0 99999 7 -1 (Password locked)
```

## Conclusion

Effective user and group management is essential for maintaining security and organization in a Linux system. Through this lab, you have learned how to create user accounts, manage groups, and control access by assigning users to primary and supplementary groups. Additionally, you explored how to lock user accounts when necessary, ensuring better security control.
